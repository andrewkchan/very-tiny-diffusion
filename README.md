# DDPM example

This is the accompanying notebook for andrewkchan's [Diffusion Models blog post](https://andrewkchan.dev/posts/diffusion.html). It's inspired by tanelp's [tiny-diffusion](https://github.com/tanelp/tiny-diffusion). We will train a diffusion model to sample from a small 2D dataset.

You can run this notebook on CPU.
